                            <p>Design Brief: Apply a visual design to multiple surfaces</p>
                            <p>Demonstrate how you can apply a common visual language for a NASA time travel app, which consists of a UI that identifies where in time you are, where in time you want to go, and an actionable affordance to initiate time travel (don’t worry about flows). Provide a screen for both an iOS phone and an Android tablet that are on brand, while also being considerate of native platform design guidelines.</p>

                            <h3 class="font-alt mt-0 mb-20">The Goal</h3>
                            <p>Create a pleasurable, humanized time travel app to help users explore and evaluate time travel options and help get travelers to and from their destinations safely with little to no impact on history.  </p>

                           <h3 class="font-alt mt-0 mb-20">The Process</h3>

                           <p>I approached this design challenge I would any other. I started by outlining goals, challenges, assumption before determining how to proceed with user research. </p>


                           <h4 class="mt-0 mb-20">Assumptions</h4>



                           <ul>   
                            <li>Time travel technology is outside the stage of infancy and is now expanding to a consumer market (somewhat similar to where space travel aims to be in the near future).</li>

                            <li>Time travel is possible to both the past and the future, although there isn't much science to support the possibility of travel to events in the past.  </li>
                            <li>Because of technical, constraints this app will act as supplementary device those who require a more powerful and robust time traveling experience have access to other machines or computers that also facilitate the traveling process.</li>
                            <li>Certain ethical questions have been answered and laws or agreements are in place to protect both time travelers and those living in other moments in time.</li>

                            <li>The technology is around to return users back from their travel destination.</li>

                            <li>This app will be used primarily in the United States. </li>
                            <li>This app will be used in  current using current devices and design patterns. </li>

                            <li>Cost of time travel is either free or the same to all locations and times. </li>

                        </ul>




                        <h4 class="mt-0 mb-20">User Research</h4>


                        <p>Because of the quick turnaround, I decided on a down and dirty research process. What could be done in the quickest amount of time that would give the most useful answers. I started my research process with three questions in mind:</p>

                        <ul class="mb-50">

                            <li>How do users currently think about time?</li>
                            <li>How do users currently think about travel? </li>
                            <li>Where would users go if they could travel in time?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>I found users who I believe would fit the target users: curious, adventurous, and interested and asked them: <strong>"If you could travel in time, where could you go?"</strong></p>

                        <ul>

                            <li class="mb-10">I would go to the future and try to find myself to see if there is anything I should tell my former self. - <em>Arian </em> </li>

                            <li class="mb-10">"I picture myself a princess living in Versailles" - <em>Lilian</em></li>


                            <li class="mb-10">I'd love to go back in time and meet William Shakespeare or Charles Dickens. Either one would be cool. - <em>lancastergal </em></li>


<li class="mb-10">I would time travel into the early years of America and try to free slaves and break down color, race, gender, and sexuality barriers. - <em>Jake</em></li>

                            <li class="mb-10">Forward!  I would travel forward :) Probably just 50 years.   To see what we are becoming and if we make it.   100 years and it would probably not make sense to me (or be a wasteland). - <em> Justin</em> </li>


                            <li class="mb-10">I would go to the Golden Age of Piracy, circa about 1723, to see how accurate "Pirates of the Caribbean" is. - <em> Jill</em> </li>
                        </ul>




                        <h4>Findings and Design Approach</h4>

                        <p>After those conversations, I was suprised to learn most research participants would choose to travel back in time, not forward. Participants most often would choose an era or period in time, not a specific destination or event. Some also wanted to travel to a specific person (usually their self, either in the past or future) with the goal of relaying information. </p>



                        <p>After researching current mental models for travel, I found most users currently pick a location and then find a way to get there during times the use is available. Then, they determine the method to get to their location based on factors such as cost, speed and availability. </p>


                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Focus guiding users towards the best destination </strong> </li>
                            <p>Because participants often provided vague answers regarding location destination, I decided to focus on guiding the user to a time and location destination they could not only travel to, but travel to safely. Since this app is designed in the present day, using tools already available, I chose to model the experience on the best parts of something the target users already know and understand: commercial airline travel or searching for a hotel. 
                            </p>

                            <li><strong>Provide social proof to ensure feelings of safety and security</strong></li>
                            <p>My assumption was time travel is outside the infancy stage but may still be new to the target time travelers. By adding reviews, we can help the user feel reassurance about time travel destinations.</p>


                            <li><strong>Get users to and from their destinations safely with little to no impact on history. </strong></li>

                            <p> The primary focus of the app is providing a safe, reliable, pleasurable experience for the users. By focusing on providing a set number of destination, rather than a time travel free-for-all (freely selecting a time and geo location),  it is easier to provide a better overall travel experience and locate time travelers in case something goes wrong. </p>
                        </ul>

                 <h3 class="font-alt mt-0 mb-20">Sketching and Wireframing</h3>
                 <p> Much of my design process takes place during the messy sketching phase before I move to wireframes. </p>

                 <p> My direction during the sketching phase changed a bit. Originally, I started this process designing an app for what I deemed the “professional traveler”. This person would most likely be employed by an organization or agency such as NASA and would need complete control over exact geo-location and time period. </p>

                 <p>But, this brought up many questions such as, what if the traveler wanted to travel to 300,000 years ago to what is now France but at the time was covered water. The professional traveler may have a reason for the expedition, but do we stop the novice traveler knowing the trip is doomed to fail? What about space travel? </p>

                 <p>Also, such a travel free for all would be hard to control and could lead to unintended consequences. (This lesson was learned by watching "The Simpson's".)</p>

                 <p class="small">Homer: I've gone back to the time when dinosaurs weren't just confined to zoos! OK, don't panic -- remember the advice your father gave you on your wedding day.
                    [In Homer's Memory:]
                    Grampa: If you ever travel back in time, don't step on anything because even the tiniest change can alter the future in ways you can't imagine.
                    —Grampa Simpson </p>

                    <p>Since my goal is to create a pleasurable, safe experience, I decided to only allow travel within this app to a predetermined time and place where we can better control the outcome.</p>

         <ul>
            <li><strong>Humanize the app by using imagery of people</strong> </li>
            <p>While studying the NASA design guidelines, I was struck by one area in particular. The focus on showing the human elements in photography. I decided to focus heavily on images of people to humanize the time travel experience to appeal to a wide range of users. </p>


            <li><strong>Focus on simplicity including a limited color palette using NASA's current guidelines.</strong></li>
            <p>I stayed within NASA's current brand guidelines and used only shades of blues, red and grey within the app to discourange information overload. Blue and grey are the primary colors with red being an accent for important page elements. Icons are clean and understated as to not distract from what is truly important -- the destination moments. </p>
